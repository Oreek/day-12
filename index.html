          Hello! Welcome to my second threejs website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This site showcases a simple 3D scroll effect that is really cool! Go ahead and scroll down now!

          This site is more of a "tutorial site" than my previous one because I had to make this really fast (under 1-1.5hrs max) and so I only made some style changes.

          BTW I did take a lot more time to research on placing a texture on a conegeometry as I was trying to make obamium but I took wayy too long to understand and study UV  mapping and still wasn't able to properly display the texture in it so heres the result of that. Also, I've made a pretty easy tweak to the torus' color where it changes upon scroll!
